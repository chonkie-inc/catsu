_🔌 Want one light-weight client library for all your embeddings? 💙 Choose Mimie! :)_

</div>

We wanted a single light-weight client library to interact with all embedding APIs and providers, with proper support. Other libraries like LiteLLM and any-llm-sdk focus a lot on chat models and not on embeddings, even though embeddings are becoming increasingly important in various applications. Mimie aims to provide a unified and efficient way to work with embeddings across different providers and APIs.
